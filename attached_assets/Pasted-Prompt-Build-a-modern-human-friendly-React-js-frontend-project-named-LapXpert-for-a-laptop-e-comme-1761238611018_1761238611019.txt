Prompt: Build a modern, human-friendly React.js frontend project named LapXpert for a laptop e-commerce store. The application must:

Authentication & Navigation:

Include a dedicated login page (/login) with an email + password form and a single “Login” button.

Simulate authentication with no actual backend—logging in simply redirects to homepage.

Use React Router for clean navigation across /login, /home, and /cart routes.

Homepage Design:

After login, direct users to a homepage (/home) showcasing 5 laptops (using the provided static dummy data).

Show for each product: image, model name, release year, RAM, storage, color, and price, in a clear decorative card-style grid.

Add a non-functional “Add to Cart” button for each product (UI only, no cart functionality).

Navbar:

Place a visually distinct navbar at the top with links: Home, Products, Cart (disabled/greyed out initially), and Logout.

Navbar remains responsive and visually consistent across screen sizes.

Styling:

Style app exclusively with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and attractive look.

Ensure all pages and product cards are mobile-responsive, visually appealing, and ready for a demo.

Prioritize a professional and decorative appearance, suitable for showcasing to others.

Code & Hosting:

Use static dummy product data for laptops, exactly as per the provided sample.

Organize code and assets to make the project easy to download, run locally, and host on GitHub Pages with minimal config.

Include clear README instructions for running locally and deploying to GitHub Pages.

If running with a local Python server, provide a simple main.py to serve static site.

Ensure all page routes and assets function after download and when invoking main.py server.

Extra:

App should use human-friendly labels, tooltips, and calls to action.

Add decorative design elements (e.g., hover effects, subtle backgrounds, etc.) to enhance appearance.

Website is named LapXpert; display branding/logo clearly.

Write easy-to-understand code, logical folder structure, and comments for learners and demo purposes.

All assets and images should be local or CDN-friendly for seamless GitHub hosting.

Static Product Data (for demo):
